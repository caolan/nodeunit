Usage:
  tap [options] <files>

Executes all the files and interprets their output as TAP
formatted test result data.

To parse TAP data from stdin, specify "-" as a filename.

Short options are parsed gnu-style, so for example '-bCRspec' would be
equivalent to '--bail --no-color --reporter=spec'

Options:

  -c --color                  Use colors (Default for TTY)

  -C --no-color               Do not use colors (Default for non-TTY)

  -b --bail                   Bail out on first failure

  -B --no-bail                Do not bail out on first failure (Default)

  -R<type> --reporter=<type>  Use the specified reporter.  Defaults to
                              'classic' when colors are in use, or 'tap'
                              when colors are disabled.

  -s<file> --save=<file>      If <file> exists, then it should be a line-
                              delimited list of test files to run.  If
                              <file> is not present, then all command-line
                              positional arguments are run.

                              After the set of test files are run, any
                              failed test files are written back to the
                              save file.

                              This way, repeated runs with -s<file> will
                              re-run failures until all the failures are
                              passing, and then once again run all tests.

                              It's a good idea to .gitignore the file
                              used for this purpose, as it will churn a
                              lot.

  --coverage --cov            Capture coverage information using 'nyc'

                              If a COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN environment
                              variable is set, then coverage is
                              captured by default and sent to the
                              coveralls.io service.

  --no-coverage --no-cov      Do not capture coverage information.
                              Note that if nyc is already loaded, then
                              the coverage info will still be captured.

  --coverage-report=<type>    Output coverage information using the
                              specified istanbul/nyc reporter type.

                              Default is 'text' when running on the
                              command line, or 'text-lcov' when piping
                              to coveralls.

                              If 'lcov' is used, then the report will
                              be opened in a web browser after running.

                              This can be run on its own at any time
                              after a test run that included coverage.

  -t<n> --timeout=<n>         Time out test files after <n> seconds.
                              Defaults to 30, or the value of the
                              TAP_TIMEOUT environment variable.

  -h --help                   print this thing you're looking at

  -v --version                show the version of this program

  -gc --expose-gc             Expose the gc() function to Node tests

  --debug                     Run JavaScript tests with node --debug

  --debug-brk                 Run JavaScript tests with node --debug-brk

  --harmony                   Enable all Harmony flags in JavaScript tests

  --strict                    Run JS tests in 'use strict' mode

  --                          Stop parsing flags, and treat any additional
                              command line arguments as filenames.
